Bragg_2002,Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park,description,"The vegetation type was fire-prone, low, open sclerophyll woodland, dominated by woody shrub species, with emergent eucalypt trees up to 9 m tall. The site was last burnt in 1990. The geology of the site is Hawkesbury sandstone, weathering to low nutrient soils (total soil phosphorus 94 mg/kg, Wright, Reich & Westoby 2001). Gap fractions (see below) were mostly in the range 0.3–0.7; the shrub species were growing in dappled light rather than in dense shade with occasional sunflecks."

Briggs_2010,Terrick Terrick National Park,description,"Soil samples for this experiment were collected from Terrick Terrick National Park (TTNP), 225 km northwest of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. TTNP is situated within the Patho Plains, a sub-section of the Victorian Northern Plains Bioregion, and includes the Terrick Terrick Range and adjacent plain. Average annual precipitation for the Patho plains is ~400 mm, with winter months weakly dominating the rainfall patterns. Seasonal average maximum temperatures range from 30 deg C in summer to 15 deg C in winter. Seasonal average minimums range from 15 deg C in summer to 3 deg C in winter. The vegetation is a semi-arid Callitris grassy woodland typical of the rocky outcrops and outwash slopes at TTNP."

Burrows_2001,The Rock,description,"The Rock Nature Reserve (lat. 357169S, long. 1477049E), South Western Slopes, New South Wales, is a small (341 ha) island of remnant vegetation surrounded by an extensively modified agricultural landscape. A north-south ridge, the highest point of which is over 350 m above the surrounding plains, dominates the reserve. Approximately 215 vascular plant species, in an open woodland with an overstory dominated by species of Eucalyptus, Acacia, and Callitris, have been recorded at this site (Burrows 1999). Of these species, 18 (8%) are trees, 36 (17%) are shrubs, 85 (40%) are perennial herbs, and 74 (35%) are annuals or biennials (Burrows 1999). The majority of the perennial herbs die back by the start of summer to an underground tuber, bulb, or similar structure, and only a few species, such as Dianella revoluta and Lomandra filiformis, stay in leaf during summer. Thus, only ca. 25% of the recorded species remain in leaf, or equivalent, for the whole year."

Catford_2014,Yarrawonga,description,"The surrounding floodplain has been used for logging, livestock grazing, as a source of charcoal and honey, and for settlement, recreation and tourism (Eastburn 1990). Current forestry practice is based on selective logging or clearing of small patches. Cattle grazing commenced in 1838 and continues today, but sheep grazing has largely ceased (Smith and Smith 1990). There was no tree canopy directly above the study wetlands. All soil in the region was similar (~45% clay content)."

Dwyer_2018,Bulli State Forest,description,"Brigalow refers to Acacia harpophylla, a long-lived Acacia growing to 25m under optimal conditions (Boland et al. 1992), and to the open forests and woodlands in which A. harpophylla is a characteristic species. Lower layers of small trees and shrubs are common but herbaceous ground vegetation is always sparse, resulting in very low fire fuel loads (Moore et al. 1967). Rainfall in the region of Bulli State Forest is variable and summer dominant, averaging 625 mm/year. Average daily minimum and maximum temperatures are 11.6 and 25.9 deg C, respectively (Jeffrey et al. 2001). Most brigalow forests in the locality have been cleared. The remaining patches of mature forests and regrowth occur on fertile vertosol (cracking clay) soils, mainly along the edge of the state forest where it abuts pasture and cropping (Fig. 1). A number of structural and floristic attributes of the regrowth (prethinning) and mature forests at the study site have been presented previously (Chandler et al. 2007). In the mature forests A. harpophylla and C. cristata form a canopy between 16 and 20m tall with a foliage projective cover (FPC, vertical projection of canopy foliage) of 75%. Acacia harpophylla is more abundant but C. cristata stems are larger on average and this species contributes three times more aboveground biomass (Table 1). The average density of canopy tree species (almost all A. harpophylla and C. cristata) is 1,488 stems/ha (Table 1)."

Edwards_2000,ReadWilsonsProm_forest,description,"Leaves were collected in November 1995 from Lilly Pilly Gully at Wilson's Promontory National Park in the far south-eastern Australian mainland (39 deg 1'S, 146 deg 0'E). The climate is relatively mild with few extremes of temperature and with an annual rainfall of c. 1000 mm (ASHTON & WEBB, 1977). The rainfall is higher and more uniformly distributed through the year than much of the southern mainland, allowing close proximity of rainforest, eucalypt-dominated forest and heath. However, none of the species investigated is endemic to this area, most also occurring in areas with a more pronounced winter-high rainfall regime.The plants were sampled over a distance of c. 500 m. The vegetation graded from Open forest dominated by Eucalyptus obliqua with a shrub and tree understorey including rainforest species, through an intermediate forest dominated by E. obliqua and E. baxteri, to a 1-2 m heath with occasional stunted E. baxteri. Banksia marginata was collected in both the forest understorey and the heath but in this study only the heath collection is reported. All plants occurred on sandy soils. The heath was recorded on highly-leached siliceous beach sands and the forest on sands derived from granite, the latter commonly with more clay and organic matter (PARSONS, 1966) and in this study with higher levels of phosphorus and exchangeable cations (Table 2)."

Falster_2005_2,Myall_Lakes,description,"The study was conducted in low-open sclerophyll forest situated in Myall Lakes National Park in southeastern Australia. Annual precipitation is moderate (1352 mm, 105 year average, Sugarloaf point), with some rain in all months. Mean annual temperature is 17 deg C. The park contains a diversity of vegetation structural types delimited by substrate variation arising from past and present dune formation (Myerscough et al. 1995). We restricted our study to a large section of the park (~8000 ha) situated on a relatively homogenous substrate of freely draining Holocene sands (Myerscough and Carolin 1986. Vegetation in the study area is characterised by an open tree-layer to 35 m consisting of Eucalyptus pilularis, E. gummifera and Angophora costata. These species are rarely killed by fire and readily resprout from epicormic buds (Fox and Fox 1986). A diverse understorey is dominated by shrubs from the families Fabaceae, Mimosaceae, Epacridaceae and Proteaceae. Most aboveground biomass among understorey species is killed by fire, with regrowth from either seed or below ground reserves. Approximately half of all species retain some capacity to resprout after fire (Fox 1988)."

Gardiner_2019,Oxley Creek Common,description,"The study site is in the inner southern suburbs of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia and is known locally as Oxley Creek Common (27 deg 32'S 152 deg 59'E, Fig. S1). It is situated on an alluvial floodplain along a section of Oxley Creek, approximately 2 km from its confluence with the Brisbane River to the north. Rainfall averages 1058 mm yr-1 and is typically summer dominant with extended dry periods in late winter and early spring (July-September). Mean daily minimum and daily maximum temperatures are 14.4 deg C and 26.4 deg C respectively (station number 40211; Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology 2017). Oxley Creek Common comprises infrequently inundated pasture and parklands on dermosols. Prior to European settlement the areas adjacent to Oxley Creek most likely supported gallery notophyll vine forest (Regional Ecosystem 12.3.1) (Queensland Herbarium 2018). While the region receives less rainfall than is typically used to define rainforest in the tropics, this type of vegetation is commonly referred to as riparian subtropical rainforest in Australia. Established in November 2016, the experiment was embedded within a larger project funded by the Australian Government's National Landcare Programme '20 Million Trees Round II'."

Goble_1981,Yule Brook Botany Reserve,description,"The study gradient was located on the Yule Brook Botany Reserve, a 34 ha area of relatively undisturbed native vegetation, owned by the University of Western Australia and vested in the Department of Botany for research and educational purposes. The Reserve lies within the outer metropolitan sector of Perth in the suburb of Kenwick. Topographically the site consists of two low, well rounded sand ridges separated by a broad, sandy flat (Fig. 1 in manuscript). The sand is excessively leached, nutrient-poor and overlies an almost impermeable clay pan. Regional drainage is poor and the position of the clay horiion at shallow depths below the surface on the flats leads to severe waterlogging conditions in winter and extreme desiccation in summer. It is the relationship between topography, depth of sand and position of the fluctuating water table that has been considered a major determinant of the vegetation pattern of the Yule Brook Botany Reserve (Speck 1952; Baird and Speck, unpubl. data)."

Henery_2001,Kuringgai_NP,description,"Sites were widely separated level surfaces with similar (9-11 yr) elapsed time since the last fire and with a common soil type derived from a geology of underlying Hawkesbury sandstone. These soils are depauperate in nutrients, notably phosphorus (Beadle 1962). The vegetation was a fire prone mixture of low heath and dry sclerophyll woodland with a species-rich (Rice and Westoby 1983) understorey of woody shrubs primarily from the families Proteaceae, Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. Only three species (genus Persoonia) had fleshy fruits, the remainder comprising relatively dry dehiscent woody follicles, legumes, capsules and schizocarps.Sites were chosen with a high proportion of species in common, since the aim was to replicate each species across two or three sites, as well as to replicate individuals within each site."

Islam_1999_1,Hamersley station Pilbara,description,"The soil type at the study sites is a silty clay loam of high P-fixation capacity and is rich in iron and aluminium oxides and poor in available N and P (Bennett and Adams 1999). Long-term annual rainfall at Hamersley Station is 354 mm, divided between 2 rainy seasons, December-March and May-August. Roughly two-thirds of the annual total falls in the summer period and one-third during winter. Because of this rainfall distribution, both summer and winter ephemeral forbs grow in the Pilbara. During June 1996-June 1997, the total rainfall was 596 mm, with 73% falling during the warmer months of December-March (Fig. 1). The mean monthly maximum temperature was about 36 deg C in January, and in July, the mean monthly minimum temperature fell to 6 deg C"

The site has a semi-arid, subtropical climate, with hot summers and mild winters and lies within the Fortescue Botanical District (Beard 1975). The Pilbara region is characterised by highly variable annual and seasonal distribution of rainfall with a generally dry winter season. Total rainfall from June 1996-July 1997 was 535 mm with 81% falling during December 1996-February 1997. Surface soils (0-10 em) at the study site had a pH of 7.1(+/- 0.5; +/- s.e.); an organic matter concentration of 1.21% (+/- 1.04); nitrogen concentration of 0.99 mg!g (+/- 0.4); available phosphorus of 4.7 ~-tg/g (+/- 1.2); and an electrical conductivity of 55.4 ~ -tS/cm (+/- 3.4). Further details of the climate, soils and general vegetation of the region may be found in Bennett and Adams (1999)."

Lawes_2012,East Point Reserve,description,"East Point Reserve is a regionally significant remnant of coastal monsoon forest (Panton 1993). The forest belongs to Group 9 of Russell-Smith (1991) and is described as semideciduous rainforest and vine thicket. Monsoon forest on the East Point peninsula was extensively cleared and burnt from 1932 to 1963 (Franklin, Matthews & Lawes 2010), and we sampled only forest remnants that had not been previously cleared or burnt."

Lawes_2012,Litchfield,description,"The vegetation in LNP is dominated by eucalypt open forests and woodlands, with a grassy understorey, referred to hereafter as tropical savanna. The seasonal climate is particularly conducive to high fire frequencies, the wet season is highly productive with abundant grass growth, while the 7-month dry season (c. May-November) strongly promotes grass curing and flammability. Fires are typically ground fires and are fuelled by native Sorghum spp. grasses. On average 66% of LNP is burnt per annum (Russell-Smith et al. 2009). Data from tropical savannas were collected from vegetation monitoring plots (20 m x 40 m) that were established between March 1994 and August 1996 in LNP. These monitoring plot data indicate that 86% of fires in LNP are of low (2 m scorch height) or moderate (sub-canopy scorch) severity. We sampled only those plots that had been burnt at least in the previous dry season or more recently and had been burnt in at least five of the previous 12 years, that is an average fire return interval of c. 1.5 years (Northern Territory Bushfires Council, unpublished data). Fire severity in the plots we surveyed was of low to moderate intensity."

Substantial areas of natural vegetation on infertile sandstone are conserved around Sydney, but most fertile soils were cleared quite early during European colonization. Only small patches of fertile-soil vegetation remain, usually within large areas of infertile Hawkesbury Sandstone. We were able to distribute our four fertile sites over three substrate types. Sites on infertile soil were then chosen to be interspersed with the fertile sites (Fig. 1), and to include both woodland and heathland vegetation, even though Rice and Westoby (1981) had found no evidence vegetation structure affected the incidence of dispersal by ants among infertile-soil vegetation types. Northernmost sites locations in Kuring'gai National Park and southernmost sites in Royal National Park. See Westoby et al. 1990 for map of site locations."

Lord_1997,Alligator River Kakadu,description,The tropical Australian flora used consists of 229 species from Eucalyptus woodland in the Alligator Rivers region of Kakadu National Park (approx. 12 deg 30'S 132 deg 30'E). This region has a dry monsoonal climate- most of the annual rainfall (which can vary from 840mm to 2800 mm) falls from December to March; however June to September is characterized by intense drought. The dataset was compiled by J.E. and supplemented with species lists from Taylor & Dunlop (1985).

Lusk_2010,shade_5-8%_canopy_openness,description,"The study was carried out in subtropical rainforest in Nightcap National Park (New South Wales, Australia) located at 28deg38min S, 153deg20min E and at an elevation of 380 m asl. Mean annual temperature at the nearest meteorological station (Whian Whian) is estimated at 22.4C and mean annual rainfall at 2314 mm, with a minimum in late winter to early spring (Bureau of Meteorology, 2009). No month receives less than 50 mm on average. Shade leaves were obtained from juveniles growing at 5-8% CO10 in the interior of the stand. Four to seven saplings per species were sampled in each light environment. There was no significant interspecific variation in mean light environments of either sun leaves (ANOVA, F = 1.19, P = 0.32) or shade leaves (F = 1.12, P = 0.36)."

Mean annual temperature at the nearest meteorological station (Whian Whian) is estimated at 22.4C and mean annual rainfall at 2314 mm, with a minimum in late winter to early spring (Bureau of Meteorology, 2009). No month receives less than 50 mm on average. Sun leaves were obtained from 50-200 cm tall juveniles growing on the forest margin or in large canopy gaps; potentially suitable plants were marked and hemispherical photographs were then taken to ensure selection only of plants growing at 15-24% CO10. This range of canopy openness is roughly equivalent to light intensities measured beneath 300-700 m2 treefall gaps in tropical rainforest by Brown (1993). There was no significant interspecific variation in mean light environments of either sun leaves (ANOVA, F = 1.19, P = 0.32) or shade leaves (F = 1.12, P = 0.36)."

Lusk_2014,Basalt,description,"In northern New South Wales, rainforest occurs widely on both nutrient-rich basaltic soils and poorer rhyolitic soils (Baur 1957; Turner and Kelly 1981). The soils derived from basalt have much higher levels of total phosphorus, and although total nitrogen levels differ much less, carbon : nitrogen ratios are also much more favourable on soils developed from basalt (Table 1). Other important differences identified by Turner and Kelly (1981) include much higher exchangeable calcium in basaltic soils, and lower exchangeable aluminium. Rainforests on basalt and rhyolite in this region correspond to the 'complex notophyll vine forest' and 'simple notophyll vine forest' structural types recognised by Webb (1968). Although some species are common to both substrates, we focus here on specialists that are strongly associated with one or the other."

OReillyNugent_2018,"Pinnacle Reserve, ACT",description,"The vegetation of the reserve comprised a scattered overstorey of trees, predominantly Eucalyptus blakelyi and E. melliodora, with a dense understorey of grasses and forbs. The vegetation has been extensively modified over the last 150 years, primarily by tree clearance and livestock grazing. Livestock grazing ceased in the reserve in 1993 and the dominant herbivore is now the native eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), which occurs at moderately high density (1.8 - 2.2 ha-1; Driscoll 2017). The understorey vegetation comprises a mix of native and non-native species, with many species introduced for pasture improvement (e.g. Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium subterraneum) or as pasture contaminants (e.g. Avena fatua and Bromus diandrus)."

Pekin_2011,Collis,description,"Near the town of Walpole, WA. We chose a single landform unit (Collis, sensu Churchward et al. (1988)) at the southern extent of southwest Australia as our study area (Fig. 1) in order to ensure a consistent species pool across our study sites. The Collis landform displays yellow duplex soils on upland, nonwaterlogged terrain, and is dominated by jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) and marri (Corymbia calophylla Lindl.) trees in the overstorey and a dense shrub layer in the understorey (see Pekin et al. in press for details on floristics). Sixteen study sites with variable fire histories were selected for conducting floral surveys within this area (Fig. 1). The recent fire history (1972-2004) of each site was obtained from a database of digitized fire boundaries produced by the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) (Hamilton et al. 2009). While the study sites had a mixed history of prescribed and wild fires, all sites were burnt by either a prescribed burn in late 2002 or a large wildfire, which burned through much of the study area in early 2003, and were not burned again prior to the time of floral surveys; hence, the last fire had occurred in the same fire season and the time since last fire was the same for all sites at the time of sampling (see Pekin et al. in press for details on fire history across the sites). In southwest Australia, the conservative interval between lethal fires has been suggested at twice the juvenile period of the slowest maturing obligate seeder (Burrows & Wardell-Johnson 2003), which corresponds to ~6 years in this ecosystem (Burrows et al. 2008). Consequently, sites for this study were selected to represent either two consecutive short fire intervals of up to 5 years (SS); two consecutive long fire intervals of 11 years or longer (LL); or mixed fire interval lengths (M) (Hamilton et al. 2009). The climate of southwest Australia is mediterranean, where most of the precipitation falls during winter and there is an extended drought over summer. Hence, even small changes in mean annual precipitation in this environment can strongly affect water stress for plants, and the regional distribution of plant species and vegetation types is primarily a function of water availability (Beard, 1983). Annual rainfall near the coast is ~1200mm but decreases sharply towards the northeast (Bureau of Meteorology 2008) with distance inland, even though the landscape is relatively flat. We obtained interpolated climatic data for the location of each of our sites for the past ~35 years (1970 to 2008) from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (2008). Local mean annual precipitation (P) was adjusted for elevation using BIOCLIM (Nix 1986), and mean annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) was calculated from an existing database of gridded climate variables (Jeffrey et al. 2001). Site aridity was quantified with an aridity index (AI = PET/P) and used as an indicator of moisture availability (Pekin et al. 2009). Our study area displays a relatively sharp gradient of increasing rainfall from ~850 mm annually in the northeast to ~1100mmin the southwest across a distance of ~25km (Fig. 1). Thus, the aridity index across our sites is likely to reflect a significant variation in the availability of moisture for plants over the summer drought season."

Prior_2003,dry monsoon forest,description,"The study sites were located near Darwin, northern Australia, in four distinct habitats common in the northern part of the Northern Territory. The dry monsoon forest site was at Leanyer (12.4degS, 130.9degE) while the other sites were located at Berry Springs Wildlife Park and the adjacent Berry Springs Nature Park (12.7deg S, 131.0deg E). Temperatures in this region are high all year round, with monthly means for Darwin ranging from 24.9degC in July to 29.2degC in November. Rainfall is extremely seasonal. 97% of Darwin's average annual 1710 mm rain falls between October and April; June, July and August are virtually rainless (Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology, Australia 2001). The dry monsoon forest at Leanyer has been largely actively regenerated since 1990, following cyclone damage, weed invasion and wildfire (Panton 1993). Remnant trees were used as the seed source for regeneration, so that all study species occur naturally in the area. Study trees were between 2 and 6 m tall and included remnant individuals from the original forest and planted trees that were 4-5 years old. The vegetation, soils and landforms of the Berry Springs locations have been described by Sivertsen, McLeod & Henderson (1980) and by Bowman & Minchin (1987). Each study site was about 0.5-1 ha in area. The open forest was on deep (>1 m) red massive earth, developed on highly weathered parent material. The woodland was located on shallow earthy sand with extensive surface gravel and low in nutrients (Sivertsen et al . 1980). The Melaleuca swamp was in a seasonally inundated section of a poorly drained depression. Neither open forest nor woodland had been burnt for at least 10 years, in contrast to similar areas outside the Territory Wildlife Park, where fire is frequent (Russell-Smith, Ryan & Durieu 1997). March 2002, four to six samples of soil were taken from 0.2 m depth from each habitat for qualitative texture determination (by feel; Brady & Weil 1999) and nutrient analysis. Approximately 600-800 g soil was dried at 60degC, ground, and passed through a 2 mm sieve to determine percentage gravel. Soil was then passed through a 1 mm sieve, and total Kjeldahl N and P were determined using flow-injection analysis (Lachat Instruments, Milwaukee, WI, USA)."

Mine spoil material was piled into waste rock dumps and two waste rock dumps were reforested with woodland species in 1987 and 1984 (referred to as WRD I and II, respectively). Acacia species represent the main woody species at both WRDs. The parent rock material was a loamy clayey chloritic weathered schist (WRD I) and a clayey highly weathered schist (WRD II)."

Two monsoon forest communities were studied, a deciduous monsoon forest and a closed wet evergreen monsoon forest; the latter is provided with constant moisture by a permanent spring. The deciduous monsoon forest grew on a moderately drained clayey red soil close to the floodplain. Species at the deciduous monsoon forest site included perennial, deciduous, annual, and geophyte species. The evergreen monsoon forest grew on grey loamy soil and is seasonally flooded with running water. The vegetation consists mainly of perennial trees and a very sparse ground cover."

Schmidt_2003,Kakadu12,longer description,"The lowland wetlands are treeless flood plains with trees along river channels, billabongs (waterholes) or swamps (Brock 1988). They are inundated during the wet season and support a comparatively low number of species dominated by members of the Cyperaceae and Poaceae, and a range of aquatic plants. For this study, two wetlands, one disturbed (near the Kakadu highway) and one un- disturbed (near Radon Spring), were sampled. The disturbed wet- land site was a clayey loam flooded with running fresh water during the wet season. This site was affected by wallowing and grazing of feral pigs and water buffaloes."

Schmidt_2003,Kakadu13,longer description,"The lowland wetlands are treeless flood plains with trees along river channels, billabongs (waterholes) or swamps (Brock 1988). They are inundated during the wet season and support a comparatively low number of species dominated by members of the Cyperaceae and Poaceae, and a range of aquatic plants. For this study, two wetlands, one disturbed (near the Kakadu highway) and one un- disturbed (near Radon Spring), were sampled. The disturbed wet- land site was a clayey loam flooded with running fresh water during the wet season. This site was affected by wallowing and grazing of feral pigs and water buffaloes."

The non- eucalypt understorey includes evergreen species as well as obligate and facultative deciduous species. There is a moderate vegetation cover with annual and perennial grasses, herbs, and vines during the wet season. Two natural eucalypt woodland sites, located near the Ranger uranium mine and at Kapalga, had not been subjected to are for 3-4 years prior to sampling.

Disturbed eucalypt woodlands included a site at Kapalga which had been burnt annually since 1990 (burnt woodland) in the late dry season. Another eucalypt woodland located near the Ranger uranium mine, which received irrigation with excess mine waste water in the wet season, was studied (irrigated eucalypt woodland). Waste water from the ore-leaching process was applied to the site in 1985, 1987, 1989, and 1991. During those five years the site received a substantial input of mineral elements, in particular sulfate (26,000 kg ha)1), magnesium (5500 kg ha)1), sodium (1600 kg ha)1) and calcium (1,100 kg ha)1). In contrast, the content of P and N (as NO3 ) in the waste water was low (Ashwath personal communication). MgSO4 salt crusts partly cover the soil surface and the water table is high (within 1 m).

The soil is a sandy loam (3-10 m depth) over a grey clay or sandstone. The groundwater which was used for irrigating the trees in the year of establishment is moderately saline (2000 mg g1) and occurs at 60 m below the surface. Tree height at sampling in 2004 ranged between 2 and 9 m."

Sendall_2016,Basalt,description,"The study was carried out in Nightcap National Park (NSW, Australia), which has a subtropical climate with high rainfall in the summer and autumn, and a short dry season in winter. Mean annual rainfall at the nearest meteorological station (Whian Whian) is estimated at 2300 mm and mean annual temperature at 17.6C (Bureau of Meteorology, http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/). Our measurements were made in two forest stands of ca. 10 ha in area located at 28deg 630S, 153deg 360E and 28deg 640S, 153deg 340E at elevations of 200-300 m above sea level. The first stand at Nightcap Range Road is associated with rhyolite soil, while the second stand at Rocky Creek Dam grows on basalt soil. The basalt soils are deeper and more fertile, containing much higher levels of phosphorus than rhyolite soils, as well as a significantly lower C : N ratio. As a result of this difference in resource availability, the forest communities are quite different. Stands on basalt are much more species-rich, while stands on rhyolite are relatively low in complexity and often dominated by just a few species (Royer et al. 2009). We chose sites on each substrate with little relief to ensure that drainage and water availability did not vary much between comparisons."

Taseski_2017,Royal National Park,description,"The study was conducted in an area of wet heathland vegetation within the Royal National Park, New South Wales, Australia (34 deg 5'43.22""S, 151 deg 9'9.97""E) in May 2016 to January 2017. The site is within the study area of Letten et al.(2015) on a local soil moisture gradient, which marks a transition between two vegetation classes known as Sydney Coastal Heaths on drier soils and Coastal Heath Swamps on wetter soils (Keith 2004). Both communities are comprised of sclerophyllous woody shrub layer and an herbaceous ground layer (denser in heath swamp), with species in the Proteaceae, Ericaceae, Myrtaceae, Fabaceae, Restionaceae, Poaceae and Cyperaceae dominant throughout (Keith, 2004). The soils are sandy loams derived from sandstone, acidic and low in nutrient concentrations (Keith and Myerscough 1993). Parts of the site were subjected to low intensity burns in 2015 and in 1994. We sampled patches with different fire histories in order to control for some of the variation that may be induced by these events."

Vesk_2004,Round Hill Camp,description,"Round Hill Nature reserve, NSW. The climate is warm and semi-arid. The closest meteorological station, Mt. Hope 30 km north-west, has median annual rainfall of 370 mm (220- 595, 1st to 9th deciles), and mean maximum daily temperatures ranging from 14.28C in July to 32.58C in February (Fig. 1). Monthly rainfall is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, but is associated with patchy thunderstorms in summer and persistent but less intense fronts in winter. The area comprises low hills and foot-slopes, plains and dune fields, with dominant vegetation types open Callitris glaucophylla -Eucalyptus populnea woodland and Eucalyptus dumosa -E. socialis shrub mallee woodland (Cohn 1995). Wildfire in open woodland recurs every 5_/20 years when years of above average rainfall allow sufficient grass (Stipa spp. ) fuel to build up (Walker et al. 1981, reviewed by Hobbs 2002). In these fires, mature trees may escape total leaf scorch, while shrubs and ground storey commonly experience total leaf scorch. Mallee woodland experiences fire with a similar mean frequency, though with less variable inter-fire periods as Triodia scariosa (porcupine grass) fuel breaks down more slowly than Stipa spp. in open woodland and so is retained over a number of years (Bradstock 1989, Noble 1989, Bradstock and Cohn 2002). In mallee fires, all growth forms commonly experience total leaf scorch, allowing for patchiness in intensity, in turn dependent upon the balance More info on Round Hill Sites in Cohn, J. S. (1995).

Vesk_2019,Round Hill-Nombinnie Nature Reserve,details,"A clip-and-burn experiment was conducted in the field on 46 species of plants across 4 growth forms in order to score resprouting success (see Vesk et al., 2004 for details). We included 42 of these species in the present analysis. The experiment took place in Round Hill-Nombinnie Nature Reserve, central NSW, Australia (-32.965, 146.161). The climate in this region is warm and semi-arid. At the nearest meteorological station (Mt. Hope), median annual rainfall is 370 mm and mean daily maximum temperatures range from 14.2 deg C in winter to 32.5 deg C in summer. Land systems comprised low hills, plains and dunefields. Soils included loamy red sands light red clays and light red browns earths. Vegetation types were predominantly open Callitris glaucophylla - Eucalyptus populnea woodland and Eucalyptus dumosa - E. socialis shrub mallee woodland (Cohn, 1995). Both open woodland and mallee woodland experience wildfire roughly on 5-20 year frequency. In mallee fires all growth forms tend to experience total leaf scorch, whereas mature trees of open C. glaucophylla - E. populnea woodland may escape leaf scorch. There is light to moderate browsing by Western Grey kangaroos, Macropus fuliginosus, and feral goats, Capra hircus."

Westoby_2003,Ku-Ring-Gai Chase National Park,description,"The main dataset concerns perennial dicotyledonous species from low-nutrient Hawkesbury sandstone near Sydney, Australia (66 mg kg-1 total soil P, from five samples to 10 cm depth spaced across the site, amalgamated before analysis). The vegetation there is woody, sclerophyll, evergreen, fire-prone and species-rich. Data were collected in August 1999 as a practical exercise in Biol368 Ecology and Evolution, Macquarie University. The field site was on a broadly level plateau at latitude 33 deg 41'38''S, longitude 151 deg 08'35''E in Ku-Ring-Gai Chase National Park. In this vegetation seedlings establish following fire, or pre-existing individuals resprout. The previous fire occurred in 1990 at this site; consequently the individuals studied were well-established. Heights ranged from 20 cm for some low woody herbs, to 6 m for some eucalypts. Rainfall at the site averages ca. 1,200 mm distributed through all seasons of the year. Growth slows but does not stop across the cooler months."

Wright_2019,Howard_Springs,description,"We sampled species at Howard Springs Nature Reserve, 30 km east from Darwin. The savanna vegetation there is typical of the region, with an overstory dominated by eucalypts and an understory dominated by C4 grasses. Overstory leaf area index ranges between about 0.6 in the dry season to 1 in the wet season (Hutley et al. 2001). At Darwin airport (20 km to the west), long-term annual rainfall is 1736 mm, typically with >95% of rain falling during the wet season (October-April). Mean annual temperature is 27.6 deg C (data from www.bom.gov.au). Fires occur regularly in the dry season; typical fire return intervals in the region are 1-3 years (Russell-Smith et al. 2003). Soils at the site are sandy and low in nutrients: mean (and standard deviation) nutrient concentrations in eight soil samples (0-20 cm depth) collected in September 2010 were as follows: total C = 2.7% (1.8), total N = 0.093% (0.074), total P = 72.7 mg kg_1 (22.6)."
